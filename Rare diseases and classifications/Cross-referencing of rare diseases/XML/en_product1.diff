Histopathologically, three subtypes (classic, cellular, and mixed) can be distinguished. The tumor most commonly involves the renal sinus and is typically discovered as a palpable abdominal mass. Patients may also present with hypertension or hematuria, rarely with hypercalcemia or hyperreninemia. Prenatal presentation, usually with polyhydramnios, is not infrequent. The most important prognostic factor is completeness of surgical resection. Overall, malignant potential is low and clinical outcome favorable.</Contents>

Most &lt;i&gt;BRCA1&lt;/i&gt;-associated tumors are invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of no special type, typically of higher grade than sporadic tumors, and more often negative for hormone receptors. In addition, more cases with features of typical or atypical medullary carcinoma are seen in these patients.

+              <Contents>A group of rare inherited non-syndromic ichthyoses characterized by mutations in keratin genes. Mutations in KRT1 and KRT10 cause most cases of epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI), as well as congenital reticular ichthyosiform erythroderma (CRIE). EI manifests at birth with generalized blistering, which later transforms into hyperkeratosis. Severe palmoplantar involvement is suggestive of the presence of a KRT1 mutation. CRIE patients present at birth with erythroderma and scaling, often with a collodion membrane, and gradually develop confetti-like clear areas of normal skin. KRT2 mutations are associated with superficial epidermolytic ichthyosis (SEI), which is clinically similar to EI, but generally milder and more localized.</Contents>

Patients are of normal height and present with gait problems, joint pain, and enlarged joints with joint restriction and contractures. Radiological features include generalized platyspondyly, hypoplastic ilia, epiphyseal flattening with metaphyseal splaying of the tubular bones, and broad, elongated femoral necks with marked coxa valga. Histopathologic examination of cartilage shows PAS-positive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in chondrocytes.</Contents>

Macroscopically, the tumors can appear either papillary or flat and ulcerating. Histological subtypes include usual squamous cell carcinoma as the most common type, as well as basaloid, warty, verrucous, papillary, and mixed carcinomas. Patients may initially be asymptomatic but present with itching, bleeding, discharge, foul odor, and pain, as the disease progresses. Regional lymph node involvement is common, while distant metastases occur only late in the disease. Risk factors include HPV infection, smoking, poor hygiene, and HIV infection. Neonatal circumcision is implicated as strongly protective.</Contents>

Patients also present multiple contractures, late-onset relative macrocephaly, short stature, and facial dysmorphism (including coarse facial features, sloping forehead, thick eyebrows, low-set ears, prominent nose, flat philtrum, and prominent lower lip). Brain imaging at advanced stages shows diffuse abnormal white matter signal and severe atrophy. Sural nerve biopsy reveals decreased myelination.</Contents>

Skin biopsy shows a diffuse, monomorphous infiltrate of medium-sized blast cells resembling either lymphoblasts or myeloblasts, with massive involvement of the dermis. The clinical course is aggressive, and age has an adverse impact on prognosis.</Contents>

Only few families with BDC have been reported in the literature. The ring finger is usually the longest digit. Short metacarpals and symphalangism are occasionally present. Heterozygous mutations in the cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein 1, also known as growth/differentiation factor-5 gene (&lt;i&gt;GDF5&lt;/i&gt;), have been reported in BDC patients. Many studies support an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.</Contents>
