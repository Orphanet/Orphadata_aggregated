Likewise, aphasia is more frequent in pediatric patients. Other signs and symptoms include seizures, headache, vomiting, and alterations in the level of consciousness. Children under one year of age are more likely to present with seizures and altered level of consciousness, while older children more often show focal neurological deficits.</Contents>

Facial dysmorphism with a pseudo-myopathic appearance has been reported, which may include high anterior hairline or low frontal hairline with central cowlick, flat forehead, ptosis, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, ears with thick helices, broad depressed nasal bridge with anteverted nares, short columella, long philtrum, high-arched palate, broad mouth with thick vermilion border of the upper or the lower lip and downturned corners. Marked hypotonia, seizures and global developmental delay have been reported, associated with autistic spectrum disorder manifestations in some patients.</Contents>

The disease typically manifests in childhood or adolescence with an acute onset, often with acute liver failure. Long-term immunosuppression is usually required. Reported concurrent autoimmune diseases are autoimmune thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus, and vitiligo.</Contents>

Patients typically present in the fourth decade of life or later and without a family history of angioedema. Clinical manifestation includes nonpitting edema of the skin predominantly involving the face, but also the limbs or genitals, as well as abdominal pain due to involvement of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and severe edema of the upper airway and oral mucosa. Laboratory examination shows low C1-INH activity and low C3, C4, and C1q levels. Autoantibodies to C1-INH are frequently detectable.</Contents>

+              <Contents>A rare genetic adrenal disease characterized by primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) and/or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Male patients typically present with AI with acute onset in infancy or insidious onset in childhood. Clinical features of AI include hyperpigmentation, vomiting, poor feeding, failure to thrive, seizures, vascular collapse, and sometimes sudden death. HH manifests later as delayed or arrested puberty. In rare cases, patients become symptomatic in early adulthood with delayed-onset AI, partial HH, and/or infertility. Histologically, the adrenal glands lack the permanent adult cortical zone. The remaining cells are larger than fetal adrenal cells (''cytomegalic'') and contain characteristic nuclear inclusions.</Contents>
